      "contents": "\r\nInterests\r\nI first became passionate about protecting the environment since high school. I enjoyed going on hikes and picking up trash with my school’s environmental club.\r\nAlong with my environmental work, I recently started creating content on Twitch. I try to play nature related games along with the usual video games I grew to love.\r\nExperience/Projects\r\nI attended UCLA for my bachelor’s in Environmental Science with a minor in Conservation Biology from 2011-2015. This was where I learned about the chaparral and coastal sage scrubs ecosystems in California. Here is where I also started developing my GIS skills. I earned a GIS certificate at UCLA extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
