### Interests

I first became passionate about protecting the environment since high school. I enjoyed going on hikes and picking up trash with my school's environmental club. 

Along with my environmental work, I recently started creating content on Twitch. I try to play nature related games along with the usual video games I grew to love.

### Experience/Projects

I attended UCLA for my bachelor's in Environmental Science with a minor in Conservation Biology from 2011-2015. This was where I learned about the chaparral and coastal sage scrubs ecosystems in California. Here is where I also started developing my GIS skills. I earned a GIS certificate at UCLA extension.
